i> Class Libraries

- Class Library helps us to manage code properly
- We cannot add refernce of consoleUI to class libraries beacuse it creates circular dependency

	ie: At first when the app is built it goes to ConsoleUI and look for libraries reference.
	Then it starts setting up the refernced library code. If it finds reference to ConsoleUI in that refernced library 
	it again goes to back to ConsoleUI . But the ConsoleUI has also refernce to library so it creats circular dependency.

- When we build our project the class library gets converted into dll files
- Class libraries cannot run on its own.
- Microsoft has so many dll files where it uses in various places.
- When we install .net in our computer we have access to various dll. Some of them are:
	System,System.core,System.Data

*Pro Tip: Store As much of your code in class library as possible. Dont put ConsoleUI in class libraries
